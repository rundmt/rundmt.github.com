    <p>Currently reading a draft, I am still working on it.</p>

<p>I love Kanye West and I am from the Silicon Valley. I even was at the Yeezus tour when he came to San Jose. If you’ve checked his twitter lately, Kanye has started asking for money from Silicon Valley’s elite. His whole feed is pretty entertaining, but I’ll just cherry pick a few.</p>

<p>So why can’t Kanye get any help?</p>

<p>People ask for money every all the time in Silicon Valley. VCs appear to give out million dollar checks to ideas everyday.</p>

<p>What is Kanye doing wrong?</p>

<h2 id="kanye-has-a-lot-of-ideas">Kanye has a lot of ideas.</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family.

<p>Kanye has a lot of ideas. I bet he even has some good ones, but none of us know what ideas he has. In Silicon Valley Ideas are cheap, and execution is everything.</p>

<h2 id="kanye-thinks-he-needs-a-lot-of-money">Kanye thinks he needs a lot of money.</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">but I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.</p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699307951324958722">February 15, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Startups are cheaper to run today than ever before. If you want proof go read The Lean Startup By Eric Ries. You don’t even need to read the book the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">wikipedia article</a> is probably good enough. Kanye should build an MVP for one of his ideas and get feedback.</p>

<p>Also there’s this thing called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></p>

<h2 id="kanye-needs-to-execute">Kanye needs to execute.</h2>

<p>I’m not calling Kanye lazy. The guy just released an album, and he is probably one of the hardest workers out there. The problem is if you want Silicon Valley to back you then you need to show them you have something real. Some investors might give out smaller checks for ideas, but nobody is going to give Kanye millions let alone billions for them.</p>

<h2 id="kanye-wants-somebody-to-give-him-the-greenlight">Kanye wants somebody to give him the greenlight.</h2>

<p>Kanye seems to be</p>
