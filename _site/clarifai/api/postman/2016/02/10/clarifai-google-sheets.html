    <p>I’m going to go through as basic introduction of two of my favorite things. One is a Postman a graphical API client, and the other is Clarifai a image and video tagging service that allow us to quickly get information on our content.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Google Chrome
Clarifai Account</p>

<h2 id="what-is-clarifai">What is Clarifai?</h2>

<p>Clarifai is a company that offers image tagging as a service. You send them an image or a link to an image and they give you back image tags.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-postman">What is Postman?</h2>

<p>Postman is a tool that allows us to send requests to API services like Clarifai. It’s a very nice way to get up and running.</p>

<h2 id="lets-get-started">Lets get started</h2>

<p>Navigate to <a href="https://developer.clarifai.com/">Clarifai’s developer portal</a> and sign up. Once you’ve signed up we need to create an application. Go and click “Application” on the right hand side.
You should see a page like this.</p>

<p>Click on “Create a new Application”. Go ahead and create an application. It doesn’t matter what you name it. Leave the other selections alone and click “Create Application.”</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used an API doc before you typically see something like this. In the black boxes those are what are known as curl commands. Curl commands are commands to communicate with the web from your computers command line. Curl commands are great, but they are pretty daunting for somebody not used to the command line.</p>

<p>That’s why for this tutorial we’re going to use Postman. Postman is a tool for users to interact with APIs using a graphical interface. You can download Postman in the chrome store. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon"> Link</a>. Go ahead and add it.</p>

<p>Now if you go to your Chrome apps you can see Postman. Go ahead and open it.</p>
