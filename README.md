# My Personal Website
This is the second version of my website.
About
=======
I'm using Jekyll to power my site. I set out a goal to differentiate my site from other portfolios. I think I've achieved that on the home page. I still have work to do on the blog and projects.  I wrote all the CSS and I didn't use any CSS frameworks. I also haven't used any javascript so far, I think I might keep it that way.

Goals
=======
To make a minimal/unique personal webpage. 

TODO
=====
* Add more projects
* Animations(?)
* Add blog posts about career switching
* Add blog post detailing the meteor twitter wit.ai control.
